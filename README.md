- **Intellectual Property & Branding**:  
  - We do not use **511’s logo, trademarks, or branding** in our app or marketing materials unless explicitly approved by MTC.  
  - Any use of **Muni, BART, or other transit agency branding** must comply with their respective intellectual property policies.  

- **Data Documentation Requirement**:  
  - Within **30 days of launch**, we must provide **MTC with documentation** proving our app uses their data.  
  - This can include screenshots, press releases, or a live URL of the app.
